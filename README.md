### Project structure
The project is structured as follows:

1. Simulation written in Python.
2. Simulation data results in .csv.
3. Report in pdf containing the traction diagrams.


### Project report structure
The report is structured in 3 main sections:

1. Railway line and selected track description
2. Electric vehicle description
3. Simulation hypothesis, implementation and results (traction diagrams).

### Rolling stock
The considered rolling stock is a locomotive E464 pulling 5 MVDE carriages.
